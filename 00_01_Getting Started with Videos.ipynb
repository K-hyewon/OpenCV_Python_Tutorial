        "# Capture Video from Camera\n",
        "\n",
        "Often, we have to capture live stream with a camera. OpenCV provides a very simple interface to do this. Let's capture a video from the camera (I am using the built-in webcam on my laptop), convert it into grayscale video and display it. Just a simple task to get started.\n",
        "\n",
        "To capture a video, you need to create a `VideoCapture` object. Its argument can be either the device index or the name of a video file. A device index is just the number to specify which camera. Normally one camera will be connected (as in my case). So I simply pass 0 (or -1). You can select the second camera by passing 1 and so on. After that, you can capture frame-by-frame. But at the end, don't forget to release the capture."
